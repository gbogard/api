While you can follow this course entirely in your browser, you will need to
install a few things on your computer to develop real-life Scala applications.

To be productive, you need essentially three things:

- *sbt*, the most used build tool for Scala
- the *scala* command, a REPL for Scaa
- an IDE / text editor that support the Scala language

### Installing Sbt and the *scala* command through Sdkman (Unix based systems)

Sdkman is a tool for managing multiple versions of Software Development Kits that works
on most Unix systems (including MacOs). Sdkman makes it easy to install SDKs and switch between
multiple versions.

#### Installing Sdkman

Installing Sdkman is a one-command process: 

```
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

Then you should be able to type `sdk help` and see all the available commands.
