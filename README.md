## Project goals

- Enable people to learn functional programming by following interactive courses where they
can read tutorials, do exercises, code in their browser, and complete real projects.
- Be fun : the long-term goal of the platform is to have gamification features that make learning more motivating and more sociable. The courses themselves should be playful.
- Be inclusive : the goal here is to share the love of functional programming and empower developers of all backgrounds to write beautiful code

... and of course

- be functional : besides the courses' content, the platform itself is developed with functional
programming in mind, by using a combination of Scala and ReasonML.
